# TERRA
TERRA is an application & microfluidic agnostic device that aims to bride the gap between microfluidics and benchtop biology. TERRA enables researchers to unload the outputs of microfluidic experiments onto standard vessels, such as microtiter plates, in order to use equipment in the lab to run further analysis. Applications include, but no limited to, unloading onto standard well plates for analysis via plate readers and single droplet analysis via a flow cytometer.
